Description: The aphid package is designed for the development and application of
    hidden Markov models and profile HMMs for biological sequence analysis. 
    It contains functions for multiple and pairwise sequence alignment, 
    model construction and parameter optimization, file import/export,
    implementation of the forward, backward and Viterbi algorithms for 
    conditional sequence probabilities, tree-based sequence weighting, 
    and sequence simulation. 
    The package has a wide variety of uses including database searching, 
    gene-finding and annotation, phylogenetic analysis and sequence 
    classification.
